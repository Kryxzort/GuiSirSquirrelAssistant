helloo!
just walk through the tabs and read and you'll understand most of the stuff
and here's a guide for things that I think would be harder to grasp:

starting macro:
just be on the main screen and start, it will do all navigation and stuff all by itself

number of runs:
this just means how many times to complete, so mirror dungeon number of runs means how many times it does the 5 floors, so if you set 2 then it will complete 2 times/do 10 floors,
for exp and threads it will do per run, I suggest putting this according to your enkephalin, so if you have 10 enkaphalin and you are gonna do mirror dungeon than type 2 in there.
but use it however you want. no need to do extensive calculations since macro automatically detects running out of enkephalin and stops

Your team section:
so first of all, you need to go ingame, and change the name of a team to one of the things specified there, lets take burn for a example here.
change team name to burn(if confusing refer to instructions images folder inside the all data folder) > in macro toggle on the burn > done!
whatever name you choose is used to choose gifts, and items in mirror dungeon too, so if you choose burn then it will choose gifts and items which are burn

extra info:
if you toggle None then it wont choose a team and pick sinners from top left to bottom right, if you choose multiple then it will cycle through them,
when choosing gifts and packs and you have none then it will use poise.
Your team section is only for mirror dungeon, for exp and threads you should click enter on a thread/luxcavation then choose the team then go back to main menu, and activate the macro,
the macro will keep using that team unless game has to reconnect due to network issues

assign sinner to name section:
so here you just pick whatever sinner you want to be chosen and in which order on which team,
so if you do 1: Ishmael and 2: rodion on burn and 1: rodion 2: Ishmael on rupture then it will apply Ishmael first if you chosen burn and rodion first if you chosen rupture as your team

pack priority:
basically what packs to prioritize over which on respective floors

prioritize pack list over status gifts:
basically whatever pack priority you chose for the respective floor will be prioritized first, instead of current implementation where it picks one with your status it will try to find from that list first and if it cant then it will use a pack with same status.

mouse offsets:
use this if you have a weird aspect ratio monitor, tinker it by yourself so that everything is clicking at the right area.
y = up/down, x = left/right, positive value = down/right, negative value = up/left

Misc:
Debug image matches: draws rectangles around the images it finds (bugged, i think?)

convert images to grayscale: makes all the images it scans gray before scanning, this way it dont have to process rgb values, significantly increasing speed

delay between reconnection attempts: if your wifi stops working a while like 1-2 minutes or smth and limbus company throws network error then there will be 2 options
(close game) and (retry connection), but if you retry thrice without success then it forces you to close the game, whatever number you put here is the amount of time to wait between retrying

reconnect only when internet is reachable: ignores the delay between retry attempts and clicks retry when internet starts working

automation settings:
i have a good pc: when toggled off will add some delays to work with potato pc with slow ui changes currently only modifies battle() and ego_check()

graphics:
make sure to be in fullscreen (alt+enter) ingame
the macro was built in max graphics
you can try lower graphics and it might still work depending on how much did you lower it, but if anything is not working correctly then just do max graphics.

chain functions section:
it uses the stage/difficulty you put in the individual tab
and uhh yeah it just chains functions
useful for when you wanna do stuff like 3 threads (per day bonus) then do 2 exp for maybe like bp and then mirror dungeon

call a function section:
usually ignore this unless you are a advanced user
used to call functions from any module
if you wanna call battle() function from the mirror module, type mirror.battle()
was put in for my testing and stuff
